# Train Booking System

## Description
A C++ based train booking system that implements object-oriented programming concepts and file I/O operations for persistent data storage. The system manages train schedules, passenger bookings, and seat reservations.

## Features
- Train schedule management
- Passenger booking system
- Seat reservation and allocation
- Persistent data storage using file I/O
- JSON integration for data handling
- Template-based generic operations

## Technical Implementation

### Core C++ Concepts Used
- **Classes & Objects**: Train, Passenger, Booking, Schedule classes
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing train and booking data to files
- **Templates & Generics**: Generic data structures and algorithms
- **Structs**: Data structures for storing related information
- **Libraries Integration**: JSON parsing library for data serialization
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Vectors, maps, and algorithms

### Key Components
1. **Train Class**: Manages train details and seat availability
2. **Passenger Class**: Handles passenger information
3. **Booking System**: Processes reservations and cancellations
4. **File Manager**: Handles all file operations for data persistence
5. **JSON Parser**: Converts data between C++ objects and JSON format
